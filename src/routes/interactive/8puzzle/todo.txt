0) Create helper objects that allow for cancelling the astar promises, returning a function to cancel the promise
  - Also create helper function to make the generator calling code look better
  run_generator_async(generator, iterations, ms_per_iterations)

1) Seperate the heuristics functions into another file
  3) Implement linear conflicts, create a lookup table to cache the results. 
  4) The same could also be implemented for the manhattan distance. Generalize for any target_state. < Could be better implemented, but ignore for now.

2) Make the UI look better (Ignore set puzzle for now)
